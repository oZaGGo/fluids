# fluids
This is a project I made while learning about functions, arrays, and file reading in JavaScript. You can upload an ASCII art text file made with '*' characters, and it will create a basic fluid simulation. It's a fun way to practice coding while exploring ASCII art and basic animations.

- My Journer:

Creating a function to parse the text extracted from the .txt file and convert it into an array while preserving the original proportions was quite challenging. I had to carefully consider how to iterate through each character in the ASCII art, keeping track of rows and columns to ensure accurate representation.

Initially, I experimented with various approaches, but maintaining the original proportions proved to be trickier than expected. I had to handle cases where some lines might have fewer characters than others, as well as ensuring that spaces were appropriately accounted for to maintain alignment.

After several iterations and debugging sessions, I finally devised a solution that accurately converted the ASCII art into an array while preserving its original dimensions. It was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of array manipulation and the importance of maintaining data integrity in programming projects.
